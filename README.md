#Instructions
Spring boot microservice is handling the DynamoDB database. For that we have configure the credentials for accessing the DynamoDB. 
We handle that credential variables using application.properties file. So if you want to run this then you have to create a file named as application.propertirs.
In that file you have to provide your credential values as per the named variables which are used in DynamoDBConfig class.
